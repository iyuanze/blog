 Add a variable called comments to the YAML Front Matter and set its value to true. A sample front matter might look like:

 ---
 layout: default
 comments: true （ture为有评论/false为无）
 # other options
 ---

 In between a {% if page.comments %} and a {% endif %} tag, copy and paste the Universal Embed Code in the appropriate template where you'd like Disqus to load.

 Note: Comments can be disabled per-page by setting comments: false or by not including the comments option at all.
